# Org overview

The **organization overview** (what visitors see at [github.com/QuantTradingOS](https://github.com/QuantTradingOS)) is the **root README.md of the [QuantTradingOS/.github](https://github.com/QuantTradingOS/.github) repository** — a separate repo, not this folder.

**Canonical content** for that overview is maintained in this repo at:

**[.github/README.md](../README.md)** (one level up from profile/)

To update what appears on the org overview: copy the contents of `default/.github/README.md` into the root `README.md` of the [.github repo](https://github.com/QuantTradingOS/.github) and push there.

The roadmap lives in the default repo: [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/QuantTradingOS/default/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).
